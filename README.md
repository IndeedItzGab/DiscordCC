This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition script that allows player to chats with people from a discord server. It doesn't need any host services or a hosted discord bot to use this. This script use the discord bot as server-less host but still allowing to fetch the messages from discord to the server.

## Requirements

Your server must have BETA APIs enabled and "@minecraft/server-net" is included in the server's configuration. More detailed information [here](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
